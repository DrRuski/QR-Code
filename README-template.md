## My process

I started by (turning on some dope low-fi beats to increase my workflow) implementing all of the necessary HTML, followed by adjusting the CSS accordingly and making minor adjustments to both HTML and CSS as required in the process.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Coming out of the summer break it was somewhat difficult getting back into coding so this was a nice challenge to recall the different aspects of coding and semantics.
